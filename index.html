        I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. An ‘extremely credible
        source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder
        text is a fraud. I know words. I have the best words. I don't think
        anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know,
        maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could
        also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on
        their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? My placeholder text, I think, is
        going to end up being very good with women. Lorem Ipsum is the single
        greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.
        I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. He’s not a word hero.
        He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t
        captured. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes
        better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very
        inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s
        Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my
        words. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what
        people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. Look at that
        text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next
        webpage?! Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully
        understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a
        good decision. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well
        documented, are various other parts of my website.
